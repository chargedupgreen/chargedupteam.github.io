# Backend Engineer

🚀 **Intro:**

**ChargedUp** is the UK’s first and fastest growing phone charging network, comprising of over 1000 stations enabling users to charge their phones on the go, 100K and counting. We are backed by **[JamJar](http://www.jamjarinvestments.com)** (Innocent Smoothie founders), **[The Garage Soho](https://www.thegaragesoho.london)** (Tom Teichman and Sir John Hegarty), **[Founders Factory](https://foundersfactory.com)** (Brent Hoberman of last minute.com and MADE.com) and more of London's top investors. We also have a partnership with **O2,** giving all of their customers free charge across the UK. Alongside our network, ChargedUp works with the largest brands and venues and is expanding **internationally**. 

Our tech team uses Scrum-ban, balancing planned product-led sprints with ad hoc efforts, including brand partnerships and growth marketing campaigns. Despite complexity behind the scenes, the goal is to ensure an easy rental — not a novelty, but a utility users can rely on. We strive to think ahead and future-proof, driving a scalable, accessible, end-to-end experience as we internationalise. It’s an exciting time to join; we’re scaling our network quickly and need our tech to not just keep up but rather lead the way in enabling opportunities. We hire self-motivated, proactive, energetic people; we’re less about hitting targets and more about truly solving a user’s need. If you’re passionate about serverless platforms, problem-solving, writing code you’re proud of and having a little fun along the way, let’s talk.

**🏃‍♀️ About the role:**

A key member to enable our tech's success, you'll collaborate and brainstorm solutions, as well as go into code quarantine to deliver on time-sensitive deadlines. 

As with any startup, our roadmap is fluid — this is a snapshot of expected effort ahead, but we'll collaborate with business development and marketing to unlock opportunities as they arise.

**✏️ Your responsibilities:**

- Refactor, redesign and rewrite existing systems (move towards Serverless, clean code)
- Implement new features and support the product work on the apps in the backend (internationalisation, multi currency, payments, etc)
- Improve the overall operability, monitoring, performance of the ChargedUp backend systems

👍 **Need to have experience with:**

- AWS, especially Serverless Framework and generally Lambda Functions
- Variety of SQL and noSQL solutions: we currently use Aurora/MySQL but we are redesigning parts of the system to use DynamoDB
- REST APIs and in migrating codebases from Monoliths to Microservives or Lambdas, from nonREST to REST, especially when serving data for mobile applications
- Node.JS, version 10.0

Above all, you have a pragmatic approach to testing, devops and systems observability.

👌 ***Nice to have:***

- Full stack background— currently a lower priority, but we will soon rewrite our internal tooling to support Operations, potentially using React.JS
- IoT knowledge, especially within AWS tooling
- Low level programming, in either Java (JNI) or C

**🏆 Benefits*:***

- Salary & options available
- Chilled, genuinely welcoming office between Shoreditch and Spitalfields (Liverpool Street station) with great coffee, roof terrace, beer tap and even a Jägermeister tap!
- Work-from-Home Wednesday whenever a sprint permits
- Bi monthly team outings and activities
- Bi weekly team lunch at local pub
- Monday breakfast, a healthy start to our week
- Friday drinks on our roof terrace
- Summer and Christmas parties for team and friends
- Pension
- 25 days holiday
- Perks at work - discounted cinema tickets and more

We're a young, diverse team with ambitious goals, [big brands’ backing](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chargedupworld/), and a validated product-market fit solving a real user need. We take our objectives seriously but definitely not ourselves. If you're keen to join, get in touch.
